## Key Features

- **Automated Daily Monitoring**  
  Automatically checks for new newsletter content every day.

- **Intelligent Content Extraction**  
  Parses and processes new articles, converting them into vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.

- **Hybrid Q&A System**  
  Answers user questions by combining:
  - A local knowledge base of historical newsletters.
  - Live web search results for the latest information.

- **Persistent Memory**  
  Uses **ChromaDB** to persist data on disk, ensuring knowledge is retained across restarts.

## System Architecture

The system is composed of three autonomous agents:

### Monitor Agent
Scans the newsletter website and detects newly published articles that haven’t been indexed yet.

### Content Agent
Fetches and scrapes content from new article links, cleans the data, and stores embeddings in ChromaDB.

### RAG Agent
Handles user queries by:
- Retrieving relevant information from ChromaDB.
- Performing a live web search.
- Synthesizing an answer from both sources.
